**Final Questions**
_Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below. You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two, weaving together all of your answers._

* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  To ensure that my code, program, or software is both functional and secure, I like to focus on a combination of thorough testing and following the best practices in secure coding. Testing helps me catch bugs early on and lets me verify that each component works as expected throughout various scenarios. I also like to utilize automated testing tools, which enhance security by detecting vulnerabilities or potential exploits that I might've missed during my manual review. By keeping security at the forefront of each step, from planning to deployment, I'm able to deliver software that is both reliable and resilient against common issues.

* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  
  Interpreting user needs is an essential skill in software development. One approach is by gathering detailed requirements through interviews, surveys, or direct feedback from users. This step can be followed by data analysis to further understand people's needs or circumstances. Comprehending their goals and pain points helps me prioritize features that truly add value. I sometimes create user personas that help me think from the user's perspective throughout the process, to make sure the final product aligns with expectations and enhances accessibility and effectiveness.

* How do I approach designing software?

    When it comes to designing software, my main focus is on both functionality and scalability. My approach usually involves listing out any initial ideas to outline core aspects and how they interact. I pay attention to things like modularity and flexibility in design so that the software can evolve with future needs or requirements. This approach helps me build software that is easy to maintain and build upon, to lay a foundation for products that meets needs while retaining room for growth.
